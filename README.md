This repository includes the code for the manuscript "Musical rhythm categorization is predicted by neural oscillation and Hebbian learning".

Before running the code
* Download or clone the GrFNN Toolbox (https://github.com/MusicDynamicsLab/GrFNNToolbox) and add its foloders to the MATLAB path
* Change the working directory to the base directory of the repository (IRRhythms)
* Add the folder 'IRRhythms/Overrides' to the path

To run the experiments in the manuscript, please follow the instructions below.

# Experiment 1
* Train the model by running **learnRhythms.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL1';` in line 10)
* Run the experiment by running **runExperiment.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL1';` in line 10)
* Calculate stats and plot results by running **PlottingAndStatisticalCalculationFinal.m** (specify the data file at the top of the code*)

# Experiment 1A
* Train the model by running **learnRhythms.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL1a';` in line 10)
* Plot results by running **plotRhythmsContinuum.m**

# Experiment 2
* Train the model by running **learnRhythms.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL2';` in line 10)
* Run the experiment by running **runExperiment.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL2';` in line 10)
* Calculate stats and plot results by running **PlottingAndStatisticalCalculationFinal.m** (specify the data file  at the top of the code*)

# Experiment 2A
* Train the model by running **learnRhythms.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL2a';` in line 10)
* Run the experiment by running **runExperiment.m** (set `MODEL = 'MODEL2a';` in line 10)
* Calculate stats and plot results by running **PlottingAndStatisticalCalculationFinal.m** (specify the data file  at the top of the code*)

\* You can plot with either the data that you generated by running the code (saved in the Experiment folders) or the data that are included in the 'PublishedResults' folder (obtained by the authors).
